pitch-DayLength=Number of real seconds in a game day\nDefault: 600 (10 minutes)\nNote: A single day is not necessarily the cycle of the sun... E.G there could be multiple days with the sun up.
pitch-FirstDayPhaseLength=Number of "days" making up the first phase of daylight.\nDefault: 12 (120 minutes if DayLength = 600)\nNote: A single day is not necessarily the cycle of the sun... E.G there could be multiple days with the sun up.
pitch-ScaleEvolutionRate=Scalar value for how much the enemy evolves, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies easier, use a smaller value. To make them harder, use a higher value.
pitch-DebugMode=Debug mode, affects things like how verbose logging is to file.
pitch-EnemyHealthScale=Scalar value for enemy health, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies weaker, use a smaller value. To make them tougher, use a higher value.
pitch-EnemySwarmScale=Scalar value for how much the enemy spawns, must be greater than 0.\nDefault: 1 (100%)\nNote: To make the enemies easier, use a smaller value. To make them harder, use a higher value.
pitch-disableSmoke=Flamethrower/turret fire doesn't create smoke, may help with stuttering/lag
